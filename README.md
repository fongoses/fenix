Open source multi-platform simple invoice system

Idea is to make free open source invoice system. Simple and useful. According to the legal changes in Czech Republic, we decided to make system free for all to able to communicate with new ministry designed control system.

I started this project because we don't like this changes and see commercial companies looking for big business in this field. First goal is to make simplest as we can system to make invoices. Second is to connect to the new Czech ministry system and make all this public and free


We hope to somebody understand the point and help us to reach the goal. Developers are welcome
